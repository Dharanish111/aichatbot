# AI Chatbot with Streamlit and OpenAI

This is a simple AI chatbot application built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3). The application allows users to interact with an AI model through a web interface.

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: Users can type in queries, and the chatbot responds using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.
- **Secure API Key Handling**: API keys are managed securely using environment variables.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with your OpenAI API key:

    ```plaintext
    my_api_key=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
    ```

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Replace `app.py` with the name of your Streamlit script if different.

## Code Overview

- **`app.py`**: The main Streamlit application script. It contains:
  - **`get_response(prompt)`**: A function to interact with OpenAI's API and fetch responses.
  - **`main()`**: The main function to set up the Streamlit interface and handle user input.

## Environment Variables

- `my_api_key`: Your OpenAI API key. This should be set in the `.env` file for secure handling.

## Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for API interactions. If an error occurs, it will be displayed in the chat area.
